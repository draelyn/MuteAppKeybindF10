An app that mutes the active application with the press of F10 (can be changed). The program is compiled using autohotkey. Additionally, it includes the functionality for playing an audio cue when muting and unmuting the focused application. If you download just the exe then it will not play the sound cue when enabling/disabling.


To customize the hotkey, start by downloading the source code and opening "MuteHotkeyF10.ahk" in Notepad. Use Control+F to locate the "F10" at the top of the code, and replace it with your preferred keybind. After making the change, download AutoHotkey from the official website and compile the code into an executable file.


To add audio, start by downloading the source code and opening "MuteHotkeyF10.ahk" in Notepad. Use Control+F to locate the ".wav" at the top of the code, and replace it with the directory of an audio you would like to use. If no audio is changed in the code then it will not make a sound when enabling/disabling. After making the change, download AutoHotkey from the official website and compile the code into an executable file.
